# Assets Directory

This directory should contain your app icons and splash screens.

For a production app, you would add:
- icon.png (1024x1024)
- splash.png (recommended size)
- adaptive-icon.png (for Android)
- favicon.png (for web)

You can generate these using tools like:
- https://www.appicon.co/
- https://expo.github.io/expo-cli-assets-generator/

For now, the app will work with Expo's default assets.
