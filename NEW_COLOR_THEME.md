## 💡 Additional Options

If you want to adjust the color further, I can change it to:

### Other Neutral Options:
1. **Warm Gray** - `#78716C` (stone-500) - Warmer, earthy feel
2. **Cool Gray** - `#6B7280` (gray-500) - Even more neutral
3. **Soft Blue** - `#60A5FA` (blue-400) - Friendly but calm
4. **Sage Green** - `#6EE7B7` (emerald-300) - Natural and soothing
5. **Taupe** - `#A8A29E` (stone-400) - Very subtle and elegant
